This repo was created for GitHub's Hello World exercise, which teaches you the basics of using Git, the version control system, on the GitHub platform. This exercise is an assignment for computer and data science courses at Lyon College, Batesville AR, since fall 2024.
I'm adding this second paragraph as part of the exercise. Since I'm asked to write a little about myself: I've been using GitHub almost from its (public) start, since 2010, but I've only used it heavily and professionally since I used it for teaching (fall 2020).
